# EID 101 (Robotics Crash Course)

This repository contains projects and coursework from EID 101, focusing on fundamental robotic systems and development tools. (**Fall 2023**)

## Course Overview

- **Electronics and Programming**: Fundamentals of electronics, C++ programming on Arduino, integration of sensors and actuators, and Unix shell operations.
- **Computational and Control Systems**: Dynamic systems simulation with Python, feedback control systems, and algorithm visualization, and 3D modeling with Onshape.

## Project Description and Overview

This repository includes the final project developed for the course:

- **Final Project**: Designed a line-following robot and ping pong ball launcher, integrating custom IR sensors, 3D CAD modeling, mechanical components, and advanced algorithms to achieve precise navigation, projectile accuracy, and obstacle detection.
